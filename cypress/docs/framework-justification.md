# Framework Selection: Cypress

I chose Cypress mainly because it’s really easy to use—the syntax feels pretty close to JavaScript, which makes writing tests straightforward. It also doesn’t require any complicated setup or extra tools like Selenium, so it saves me a lot of time.

One thing I really like is that Cypress shows the browser running the tests in real-time, which makes debugging way easier. Plus, there’s a big community with lots of plugins and examples that I can rely on.

The debugging features like auto-waiting and DOM snapshots have been super helpful for understanding what’s going on at each step.
